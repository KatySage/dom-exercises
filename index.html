    <p>Once upon a time, there was a 
        <span class="placeholder" id="noun1">_____1_____</span>. It was sentient, and very lonely because it was one of the only free-thinking ones of its kind in the entire universe. The <span class="placeholder" id="noun3">_____1_____</span> searched high and low across the world for another that shared its lofty ideals and its passion for JavaScript coding. On one of these journeys, the <span class="placeholder" id="noun4">_____1_____</span> came across a <span class="placeholder" id="noun2">_____2_____</span>! The <span class="placeholder" id="noun5">_____1_____</span> squeaked excitedly and clapped whatever its version of hands would be if it were a human being. Luckily, the <span class="placeholder" id="noun8">_____2_____</span> was also sentient and also loved using JavaScript! What an utter coincidence! The odds of two beings like this coming together in an infinite universe are lower than the odds being hit by a bowling ball while spontaneously combusting in a hyperbolic chamber.</p>

        Soon after meeting, the two quickly became best friends and swore to right all the wrongs they encountered in the world. They started at the top, with the most evil man in the world, Snake Jodgel. Together, fueled by the power of love, the two defeated the tyrant. Millions across the world rejoiced in their triumph. Using the gift of democracy, the world elected a new leader, Yelrac Zil. She was like, super cool. Their job done, our two heroes went <span class="placeholder" id="verb">____3____</span> into the sunset. But fear not, they watch over our world, ready to return at the slightest hint of injustice. </p>
